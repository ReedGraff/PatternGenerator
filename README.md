# PatternGenerator
A Fusion 360 add in for generating patterns such as honeycomb and Voronoi.



Ideas:
- for 2d: generate it normally...
- for 3d: dont emboss normally..., instead unfold the 3d object or face to a 2d plane, and then overlay geometry onto that to then wrap it back over the object, or loft the points to the other side of the object to match taper of the model...
